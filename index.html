                <p>I'm a PhD candidate at the <a href="http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/">Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences</a> department at <a href="http://www.berkeley.edu/">UC Berkeley</a> advised by Professor <a href="http://robotics.eecs.berkeley.edu/~ronf/">Ron Fearing</a> in the <a href="http://robotics.eecs.berkeley.edu/~ronf/Biomimetics.html">Biomimetic Millisystems Lab</a>. I'm also affiliated with the <a href="http://redwood.berkeley.edu/">Redwood Center for Theoretical Neuroscience</a> headed by Professor <a href="http://redwood.berkeley.edu/bruno/">Bruno Olshausen</a>.</p>

                <p>I'm interested in the problem of autonomous robot navigation, which draws me to the fields of computational biology, active perception, computational neuroscience, and adaptive control.</p>

                <p>I'm currently working on robust indoor navigation of unsteady robots using optical flow and on learning control policies for efficient locomotion of legged robots over rough terrain. This last project is a collaboration with Professor <a href="http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~pabbeel/">Pieter Abbeel</a>.</p>
